<p>Hi, I'm CÃ©sar Costa, a 23 years old full-stack developer who loves JavaScript and front-end stuff. Currently I'm living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortaleza">Fortaleza, Brazil</a> (a sunny city with beautiful beaches, you should to visit us, really) and working remotely to <a href="http://.alboom.com.br/">Alboom</a>.</p>

<p>The main reason I decided to create this blog was to share my knowledge, but there are other reasons like document the problems I've been passing through, my study cases, new stuff I'm learning out there and put all this in practice as well. I hope you like it and learn something new!</p>

<p>I'll be always improving this blog, so it will be always a draft.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me by <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">sending me an e-mail</a><span class="visible-only-large">&nbsp;or through one of my social medias on your left</span>. It will be a pleasure to talk with you :D</p>
