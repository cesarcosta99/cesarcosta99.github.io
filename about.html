<p>Hi, I'm CÃ©sar Costa, a 22 years old full-stack developer who loves JavaScript and front-end stuff. I'm currently living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortaleza">Fortaleza, Brazil</a>, a great city with beautiful beaches, you are welcome to visit us if you have not yet.</p>

<p>The main reason I decided to create this blog was to share my knowledge, but there are other reasons like to document the problems I've been passing through, my study cases, new stuff I'm learning out there and also to put all this in practice. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p>I'll be always improving this blog, so it will be always a draft.</p>

<p>You can contact me <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">sending me an e-mail</a><span class="visible-only-large">&nbsp;or through my social medias on your left</span>. It will be a pleasure to talk with you :D</p>
